### **1. Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

* To generate a high volume of qualified leads for all four key legal services.
* To establish Vakil-Tech as a trusted, modern, and approachable brand in the Indian online legal space.
* To provide a seamless, mobile-first user experience that converts visitors into clients.
* To successfully integrate with a Supabase backend/CRM and a Razorpay payment gateway to create a complete lead-to-payment funnel.

#### **Background Context**

The Indian legal services market, especially in Tier 2/3 cities, is largely underserved by digital solutions. Potential clients perceive the legal process as intimidating, opaque, and expensive. Vakil-Tech's website aims to solve this by creating a user-friendly platform that is not just a directory, but a direct provider of legal services. By focusing on transparency, simplicity, and an empathetic "desi" brand voice, the website will build trust and make legal help more accessible to individuals and small businesses, while also catering to the needs of larger corporate clients.
