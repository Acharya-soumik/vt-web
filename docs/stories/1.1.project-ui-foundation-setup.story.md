# Story 1.1: Project & UI Foundation Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui configured,
**so that** I have a clean, consistent, and scalable foundation for building the user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js project is created and runs successfully.
2. Tailwind CSS is fully configured.
3. shadcn/ui is installed and themed with the project's red accent color.
4. The project structure is organized with dedicated folders for components, pages, and styles.
5. The primary font and color theme are configured globally.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundational story.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this foundational setup story.

### API Specifications
No API specifications required for this foundational setup story.

### Component Specifications
- shadcn/ui components will be installed and configured
- Component organization: src/components/ui/ (shadcn/ui components), src/components/shared/ (Header, Footer), src/components/features/ (feature-specific components)
- All components will be React functional components using TypeScript and React.forwardRef
- File naming: kebab-case.tsx, components PascalCase, props interfaces ComponentNameProps
[Source: docs/architecture/05-4-component-standards.md]

### File Locations
- Project root: Next.js configuration files
- src/app/: App Router pages and layouts
- src/components/ui/: shadcn/ui components
- src/components/shared/: Header, Footer, etc.
- src/components/features/: Feature-specific components
- src/lib/: Utilities, validators, Supabase client
- src/services/: Client-side API functions
- src/types/: TypeScript type definitions
- globals.css: Global styles and Tailwind directives
[Source: docs/architecture/04-3-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Jest & React Testing Library for testing framework
- Test files should be co-located with components
- Standard testing patterns for React applications
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 15 (React) with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling (no config file required with Next.js 15)
- shadcn/ui for component library
- React Hook Form for form handling (future stories)
- Zod for validation schemas (future stories)
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Testing
- Test file location: Co-located with components
- Test standards: Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- Specific testing requirements: Verify project setup, component rendering, and development server functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The foundational setup is solid with proper Next.js 15 configuration and Tailwind CSS v4 integration. However, there are several areas that need improvement for production readiness and best practices compliance.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: frontend/src/app/page.tsx
  - **Change**: Replaced default Next.js template with a proper Vakil Tech landing page
  - **Why**: The current page is the default Next.js template, not appropriate for a legal services platform
  - **How**: Creates a professional foundation that aligns with the project's purpose

- **File**: frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
  - **Change**: Moved header and footer to layout component for consistent navigation across all pages
  - **Why**: Header and footer should be shared across all pages, not duplicated in each page component
  - **How**: Follows Next.js App Router best practices and ensures consistent user experience

- **File**: frontend/src/app/globals.css
  - **Change**: Added proper red accent color variables and improved theme consistency
  - **Why**: The current theme uses generic colors, not the specified red accent
  - **How**: Ensures brand consistency and proper theming throughout the application

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (TypeScript, ESLint properly configured)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Follows architecture specifications)
- Testing Strategy: ✗ (No tests implemented yet)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All acceptance criteria are technically met)

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Replaced default Next.js template with proper landing page (frontend/src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] Enhanced theme with proper red accent colors (frontend/src/app/globals.css)
- [x] Added proper project metadata and branding
- [ ] Add basic component tests for utils and layout
- [ ] Create a proper README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Add .env.example file for environment variables
- [ ] Consider adding Storybook for component documentation

### Security Review
- No immediate security concerns found
- Next.js 15 provides good security defaults
- Consider adding Content Security Policy headers in production

### Performance Considerations
- Next.js 15 with App Router provides excellent performance optimizations
- Font loading is properly configured with next/font
- Image optimization is enabled with next/image
- Consider adding performance monitoring in production

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

**Note**: While the core setup is solid, the developer should consider implementing the unchecked items above for a more production-ready foundation.
