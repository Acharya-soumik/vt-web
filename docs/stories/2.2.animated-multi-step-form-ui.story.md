# Story 2.2: Animated Multi-Step Form UI

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - QA Approved for Production

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to interact with a simple, nicely animated, multi-step form to submit my legal query,
**so that** the process feels modern, easy, and not overwhelming.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A multi-step form component is built using shadcn/ui components and displayed in a modal.
2. Transitions between form steps are smooth and animated using Framer Motion.
3. The form has clear steps for entering personal details, selecting a service, reviewing, and submitting the ticket.
4. The form includes client-side validation using React Hook Form and Zod.
5. The third step only allows the user to submit the ticket (no payment option at this stage).
6. After submission, a fourth step ("What's Next") is shown, summarizing the next steps and prompting the user to pay a 400 advance or close the ticket. This screen must fit on a single mobile view, with clear CTAs for "Pay Now" and "Close".
7. The form is fully responsive and accessible (WCAG AA compliant).
8. Loading states and error handling are implemented for better UX.
9. Form data is properly managed and persisted between steps.
10. Modal can be opened from homepage CTAs and closed with proper cleanup.
11. Modal backdrop and escape key handling work correctly.

## Dev Notes

### Data Models
**Form Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface LeadFormData {
  // Step 1: Personal Details
  name: string;
  location: string;
  whatsappNumber: string;
  // Step 2: Service Selection
  service: 'legal-notice' | 'consultation' | 'document-drafting' | 'corporate-retainer';
  serviceDetails?: string;
  // Step 3: Review (no payment choice)
  // Step 4: Post-submission (no input, just actions)
  // Metadata
  step: number;
  submittedAt?: Date;
}
```

### UX & UI Guidance
- Step 3 (Review & Submit): Only one CTA, "Submit Ticket". No payment choice here.
- Step 4 (What's Next):
  - Show a confirmation message (e.g., "Your ticket has been submitted!")
  - Briefly explain what happens next (e.g., "Our team will review your request. To get started faster, pay a 400 advance now.")
  - Two clear CTAs: "Pay 400 Advance" (primary, prominent), "Close" (secondary, subtle)
  - Layout must fit on a single mobile screen (no scrolling)
  - Use icons/visuals for clarity and delight
  - Success animation or confetti is encouraged
