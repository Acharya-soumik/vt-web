const [buttonAction, setButtonAction] = useState<'proceed' | 'back' | 'submit-pay' | 'submit-ticket' | null>(null);
```

#### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// Add error boundary for form submission
const handleSubmitAndPay = async () => {
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    // ... existing code
  } catch (error) {
    // Add user-friendly error handling
    console.error('Form submission error:', error);
    // Show error toast/notification to user
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

#### **3. Accessibility Enhancements**
```typescript
// Add focus management for modal
useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    // Focus first form element when modal opens
    const firstInput = document.querySelector('input');
    firstInput?.focus();
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

### 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**
