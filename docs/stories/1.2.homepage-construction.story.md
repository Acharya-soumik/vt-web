- **Impact**: No automated testing for component rendering, accessibility, or responsive behavior
- **Recommendation**: Implement Jest + React Testing Library tests for all components

#### **2. Component Reusability** üîß **ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY**
- **Issue**: Service cards and testimonials use inline data instead of reusable components
- **Impact**: Code duplication and maintenance overhead
- **Recommendation**: Extract `ServiceCard` and `TestimonialCard` components

#### **3. Animation & Micro-interactions** üé® **UX ENHANCEMENT**
- **Issue**: Static components lack engaging animations
- **Impact**: Less engaging user experience
- **Recommendation**: Add Framer Motion for hover effects and page transitions

#### **4. SEO Optimization** üìà **PERFORMANCE GAP**
- **Issue**: Missing structured data and meta descriptions
- **Impact**: Poor search engine visibility
- **Recommendation**: Add JSON-LD schema and meta tags

#### **5. Error Boundaries** üõ°Ô∏è **RELIABILITY GAP**
- **Issue**: No error boundaries for component failures
- **Impact**: Potential for complete page crashes
- **Recommendation**: Implement React Error Boundaries
