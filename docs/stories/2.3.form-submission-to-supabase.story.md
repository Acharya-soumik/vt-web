# Story 2.3: Form Submission to Supabase

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to connect the interactive lead form to the Supabase backend,
**so that** when a user submits their details, the data is saved to the CRM before the payment step.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When the user proceeds from the details step, a function sends the form data to the Supabase "leads" table.
2. The lead is created in Supabase with an initial status (e.g., "Pending Payment").
3. Proper error handling is implemented.
4. The user is seamlessly transitioned to the final, optional payment step.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Create Next.js API route for lead submission (src/app/api/leads/route.ts)
  - [ ] Implement server-side Supabase client configuration
  - [ ] Add proper error handling and validation in API route
  - [ ] Test API endpoint with various data scenarios
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create client-side service layer for API communication (src/services/lead-service.ts)
  - [ ] Implement lead submission function with proper error handling
  - [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces for API request/response
  - [ ] Test service layer integration with form components
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Integrate form submission with existing multi-step form
  - [ ] Add loading states during form submission
  - [ ] Implement success/error feedback to user
  - [ ] Ensure seamless transition to payment step after successful submission
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Configure proper lead status mapping in database
  - [ ] Add environment variable validation
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and user feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Supabase backend is successfully set up with leads table and RLS policies (Story 2.1)
- Animated multi-step form UI is complete with 3-step process (Story 2.2)
- Form data structure is defined with LeadFormData interface
- Form validation using Zod schemas is already implemented
- Form data persistence using localStorage is working
- Modal and form components are fully functional with proper state management

### Data Models
**API Request/Response Structure:**
```typescript
// API Request (from form data)
interface LeadSubmissionRequest {
  name: string;
  location: string;
  whatsappNumber: string;
  service: 'legal-notice' | 'consultation' | 'document-drafting' | 'corporate-retainer';
  serviceDetails?: string;
  paymentChoice: 'pay-advance' | 'submit-only';
  whatsappConsent: boolean;
}

// API Response
interface LeadSubmissionResponse {
  success: boolean;
  leadId?: string;
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
}

// Database Lead Record (from Story 2.1)
interface LeadRecord {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  whatsapp_number: string;
  service: string;
  service_details?: string;
  payment_choice: string;
  whatsapp_consent: boolean;
  payment_status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  status: 'new' | 'processing' | 'completed';
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
- **API Route**: POST /api/leads (src/app/api/leads/route.ts)
- **Server-Side Client**: Use src/lib/supabase-server.ts for database operations
- **Validation**: Server-side validation using existing Zod schemas from src/lib/validators/lead-form.ts
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Response Format**: JSON with success/error indicators
- **Environment Variables**: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
[Source: docs/architecture/06-5-api-integration.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Service Layer**: src/services/lead-service.ts for client-side API communication
- **API Route**: src/app/api/leads/route.ts for server-side processing
- **Form Integration**: Update existing MultiStepForm component to call API
- **Loading States**: Add submission loading indicators to form buttons
- **Error Handling**: Display error messages in form UI
- **Success Feedback**: Show success confirmation before proceeding to payment step

### File Locations
- API route: src/app/api/leads/route.ts
- Service layer: src/services/lead-service.ts
- Supabase server client: src/lib/supabase-server.ts
- Form validation: src/lib/validators/lead-form.ts (existing)
- Form types: src/types/lead-form.ts (existing)
- Form components: src/components/features/lead-form/ (existing)
- Environment variables: .env.local, .env.example
[Source: docs/architecture/04-3-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Test file location: src/app/api/__tests__/ and src/services/__tests__/
- Test standards: Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- Specific testing requirements: Test API route functionality, service layer integration, form submission flow, error handling scenarios
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 15 (React) with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase as backend service
- React Hook Form for form state management (existing)
- Zod for validation schemas (existing)
- Environment variable management for credentials
- Proper error handling and user feedback
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Integration Requirements
- **Form Data Mapping**: Transform LeadFormData to database schema format
- **Status Management**: Set initial payment_status to 'pending' and status to 'new'
- **Error Recovery**: Handle network errors, validation errors, and database errors
- **User Experience**: Maintain form state during submission and provide clear feedback
- **Security**: Validate all input data server-side before database insertion
- **Performance**: Optimize API response times and handle concurrent submissions

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Validation Errors**: Display specific field-level error messages
- **Database Errors**: Log errors and show user-friendly messages
- **Timeout Handling**: Set appropriate timeout limits for API calls
- **Fallback Behavior**: Allow form to continue with local storage if API fails

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading States**: Show loading spinners during API calls
- **Progress Indication**: Clear feedback on submission progress
- **Error Recovery**: Allow users to retry failed submissions
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear success message before proceeding
- **Data Persistence**: Maintain form data in localStorage as backup
- **Accessibility**: Ensure error messages are accessible to screen readers

### Testing
- Test file location: src/app/api/__tests__/ and src/services/__tests__/
- Test standards: Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- Specific testing requirements: Test API route with valid/invalid data, test service layer error handling, test form submission integration, test error scenarios and user feedback
