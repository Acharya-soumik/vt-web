# Story 2.4: Optional Razorpay Payment Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user who chooses to pay,
**I want** to complete the advance payment via Razorpay within the form,
**so that** my query is initialized immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When the user clicks "Submit and Pay Advance," the Razorpay payment modal is triggered.
2. The payment amount is correctly calculated.
3. Upon successful payment, a callback function updates the lead's status in the Supabase table to "Paid".
4. The user is shown a final success message confirming both their submission and payment.

  - [x] Install and configure Razorpay SDK for Next.js
  - [x] Create payment amount calculation logic based on service selection
  - [x] Implement Razorpay payment modal trigger function

  - [x] Add proper error handling for payment failures
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Integrate payment callback with existing lead form flow
  - [x] Update lead service to handle payment status updates
  - [x] Implement success message component for payment confirmation

  - [x] Add environment variables for Razorpay credentials
  - [x] Implement payment amount validation and display
  - [x] Test payment flow with different service selections

### Data Models
**Payment Integration Data Structures:**
```typescript
// Payment Configuration
interface PaymentConfig {
  service: 'legal-notice' | 'consultation' | 'document-drafting' | 'corporate-retainer';
  amount: number;
  currency: 'INR';
  description: string;
}

// Razorpay Payment Request
interface RazorpayPaymentRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  receipt: string;
  notes: {
    leadId: string;
    service: string;
    customerName: string;
  };
}

// Payment Verification Response
interface PaymentVerificationResponse {
  success: boolean;
  paymentId?: string;
  leadId?: string;
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
}

// Updated Lead Record (after payment)
interface LeadRecord {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  location: string;
  whatsapp_number: string;
  service: string;
  service_details?: string;
  payment_choice: string;
  whatsapp_consent: boolean;
  payment_status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  status: 'new' | 'processing' | 'completed';
  payment_id?: string;
  payment_amount?: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
- **Payment Verification Route**: POST /api/payment/verify (src/app/api/payment/verify/route.ts)

- **Server-Side Client**: Use src/lib/supabase-server.ts for database operations
- **Razorpay Integration**: Use Razorpay Node.js SDK for server-side operations
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages for payment failures
- **Response Format**: JSON with success/error indicators and payment details
- **Environment Variables**: RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID

### Testing Requirements
- Test file location: src/app/api/__tests__/ and src/services/__tests__/
- Test standards: Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- Specific testing requirements: Test payment flow integration, Razorpay SDK integration, payment verification, error handling for failed payments, success flow validation
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 15 (React) with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Razorpay SDK for payment processing
- Supabase as backend service for lead management
- React Hook Form for form state management (existing)
- Environment variable management for Razorpay credentials
- Proper error handling and user feedback for payment failures
[Source: docs/architecture/03-2-frontend-tech-stack.md]

### Integration Requirements
- **Payment Flow**: Integrate Razorpay checkout modal with existing form submission
- **Status Management**: Update lead payment_status to 'paid' after successful payment
- **Error Recovery**: Handle payment failures, network errors, and verification errors
- **User Experience**: Maintain form state during payment processing and provide clear feedback
- **Security**: Verify payment signatures server-side before updating lead status
- **Performance**: Optimize payment modal loading and verification response times

### Payment Configuration
- **Service Pricing**: Define fixed amounts for each service type
- **Currency**: INR (Indian Rupees) as per Razorpay requirements
- **Receipt Generation**: Create unique receipt IDs for each payment
- **Notes**: Include lead ID and service details in payment notes
- **Environment**: Support both test and production Razorpay environments

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Payment Failures**: Display specific error messages from Razorpay
- **Network Errors**: Retry mechanism for payment verification
- **Verification Errors**: Handle signature verification failures
- **Timeout Handling**: Set appropriate timeout limits for payment processing
- **Fallback Behavior**: Allow users to retry failed payments or proceed without payment

### User Experience Considerations
- **Loading States**: Show payment processing indicators during checkout
- **Progress Indication**: Clear feedback on payment verification progress
- **Error Recovery**: Allow users to retry failed payments
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear success message with payment details
- **Accessibility**: Ensure payment modal is accessible to screen readers
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure payment flow works on mobile devices

### Security Considerations
- **Payment Verification**: Verify Razorpay payment signatures server-side
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of Razorpay credentials
- **Data Validation**: Validate all payment data before processing
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all payment communications use HTTPS
- **Error Logging**: Log payment errors without exposing sensitive data
