### Data Models
No specific data models required for this static landing pages story. Content will be hardcoded in components, similar to the homepage approach.

### API Specifications
No API specifications required for this static landing pages story. All content will be static. CTAs will be placeholder buttons that can be connected to the lead form in future stories.

### Component Specifications

- Landing page components will be organized in src/components/features/landing-pages/ directory
- All components will be React functional components using TypeScript and React.forwardRef
- File naming: kebab-case.tsx, components PascalCase, props interfaces ComponentNameProps
- Use shadcn/ui components where appropriate (Button, Card, etc.) for consistency
- Follow the same responsive design patterns established in the homepage
