### Data Models
**Analytics Event Tracking Structures:**
```typescript
// Analytics Event Types
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  event: string;
  properties?: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp?: number;
}

// Page View Event
interface PageViewEvent extends AnalyticsEvent {
  event: 'page_view';
  properties: {
    page_path: string;
    page_title: string;
    page_referrer?: string;
  };
}

// Conversion Events
interface LeadFormSubmittedEvent extends AnalyticsEvent {
  event: 'lead_form_submitted';
  properties: {
    service: string;
    payment_choice: 'pay-advance' | 'submit-only';
    form_step_count: number;
  };
}

interface PaymentCompletedEvent extends AnalyticsEvent {
  event: 'advance_paid';
  properties: {
    service: string;
    payment_amount: number;
    payment_method: 'razorpay';
    lead_id: string;
  };
}

interface ServiceSelectedEvent extends AnalyticsEvent {
  event: 'service_selected';
  properties: {
    service: string;
    step_number: number;
  };
}
```

## QA Results 
*To be filled by QA agent* 

### Review Summary

**Status:** All acceptance criteria and tasks are marked complete. The implementation covers analytics provider selection, script injection, event/page tracking, error handling, and configuration. However, there are some gaps in automated test coverage and utility files.

---

#### 1. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**

- **AC1 (Provider chosen/configured):**  
  - Google Analytics 4 is selected and configured via `src/lib/analytics-config.ts`.
  - Environment variables are used for provider and measurement ID.

- **AC2 (Tracking script on all pages):**  
  - GA4 script is injected in `src/app/layout.tsx` using Next.js `<Script>`.
  - Page view tracking is triggered on route changes in `ClientLayout`.

- **AC3 (Key conversion events tracked):**  
  - `trackEvent` and `trackPageView` functions in `analytics-service.ts` are available for event tracking.
  - The hook `useAnalytics` exposes these for use in components.

- **AC4 (Page views for all main pages):**  
  - `ClientLayout` uses `usePathname` and `useEffect` to log page views on every route change.

---

#### 2. **Code Quality & Architecture**

- **Service Layer:**  
  - `analytics-service.ts` provides a clean, typed API for event/page tracking and error handling.
  - Debug logging is enabled in non-production environments.
  - Graceful fallback if analytics is not available.

- **Configuration:**  
  - `analytics-config.ts` centralizes provider and ID configuration.
  - Uses environment variables for flexibility and security.

- **Hook:**  
  - `useAnalytics` provides a React-friendly API for logging events and page views.
  - Includes a test utility for development.

- **Layout Integration:**  
  - Analytics script is injected only if a measurement ID is present.
  - No blocking of page rendering.

---

#### 3. **Testing & Utilities**

- **Automated Tests:**  
  - No test files found in `src/services/__tests__` or `src/hooks/__tests__` as required by the story and architecture docs.
  - `package.json` includes a Jest test script and configuration, but no analytics-related test files are present.
  - **Recommendation:** Add unit tests for `analytics-service.ts` and `useAnalytics.ts` to cover event tracking, error handling, and debug utilities.

- **Analytics Utilities:**  
  - No `analytics-utils.ts` file found, though referenced in the story.  
  - **Recommendation:** If utilities are needed (e.g., for event property validation or batching), create and document them.

---

#### 4. **Error Handling, Privacy, and Performance**

- **Error Handling:**  
  - All analytics calls are wrapped in try/catch with debug logging.
  - `validateAnalyticsSetup` checks for script availability.

- **Privacy & Security:**  
  - No PII is sent by default; only event names and properties.
  - Uses HTTPS for script loading.
  - Environment variables are used for credentials.

- **Performance:**  
  - Script is loaded `afterInteractive` to avoid blocking rendering.
  - Analytics does not block user interactions.

---

#### 5. **Other Observations**

- **Consent/Privacy Compliance:**  
  - No explicit consent mechanism is implemented. If required for GDPR, add a consent banner or opt-in logic.
- **Debug Mode:**  
  - Debug logging is present and controlled by environment.

---

### **Action Items / Recommendations**

1. **Add Automated Tests:**  
   - Create unit tests for `analytics-service.ts` and `useAnalytics.ts` in appropriate `__tests__` directories.
   - Test event tracking, error handling, and debug utilities.

2. **Document Analytics Utilities:**  
   - If any analytics utilities are needed, create `analytics-utils.ts` and document their usage.

3. **Consent Mechanism:**  
   - If privacy regulations apply, implement a user consent mechanism for analytics.

4. **Update Story:**  
   - Mark QA as complete after tests and utilities are added.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The analytics integration is well-architected, covers all acceptance criteria, and follows best practices for error handling, configuration, and performance. The main gap is the lack of automated tests for analytics logic. Addressing this will ensure long-term maintainability and quality.
