# Story 4.1: Performance Optimization and Monitoring

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** business owner,
**I want** the website to be optimized for performance and have comprehensive monitoring in place,
**so that** users have a fast, reliable experience and I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are optimized to meet Google's recommended thresholds.
2. Page load times are under 3 seconds on 4G connections for all critical pages.
3. Image optimization is implemented with next/image and proper sizing.
4. Bundle size is analyzed and optimized to reduce JavaScript payload.
5. Error monitoring and alerting is implemented for production issues.
6. Performance monitoring dashboard is set up to track key metrics.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Analyze current Core Web Vitals using Lighthouse
  - [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks in critical pages
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
  - [ ] Optimize font loading and reduce layout shifts
  - [ ] Test performance improvements on mobile devices
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Audit all images and convert to next/image components
  - [ ] Implement responsive image sizing and formats
  - [ ] Add proper alt text and loading strategies
  - [ ] Optimize hero images and service page visuals
  - [ ] Test image loading performance improvements
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Analyze current bundle size using webpack-bundle-analyzer
  - [ ] Identify and remove unused dependencies
  - [ ] Implement code splitting for route-based chunks
  - [ ] Optimize third-party library imports
  - [ ] Test bundle size reduction impact
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Set up error monitoring service (Sentry or similar)
  - [ ] Configure error alerting for critical issues
  - [ ] Implement error boundary components
  - [ ] Add error tracking for API calls and form submissions
  - [ ] Test error monitoring in development and staging
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring dashboard
  - [ ] Configure Core Web Vitals tracking
  - [ ] Implement custom performance metrics
  - [ ] Set up alerts for performance degradation
  - [ ] Document monitoring setup and maintenance procedures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- SEO implementation (Story 3.2) provides good foundation for performance optimization
- Analytics integration (Story 3.1) can be extended for performance monitoring
- All core pages are functional and can be optimized for better performance
- Next.js App Router structure is established and ready for optimization

### Data Models
**Performance Metrics Structure:**
```typescript
// Performance monitoring types
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  lcp: number; // Largest Contentful Paint
  fid: number; // First Input Delay
  cls: number; // Cumulative Layout Shift
  ttfb: number; // Time to First Byte
  fcp: number; // First Contentful Paint
}

// Error tracking types
interface ErrorEvent {
  message: string;
  stack?: string;
  component?: string;
  userAgent: string;
  url: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId?: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Performance Monitoring API:**
- Extend existing analytics service to include performance metrics
- Add error tracking endpoints for client-side error reporting
- Implement performance data aggregation and alerting

### Component Specifications
**Performance Optimization Components:**
- Implement lazy loading wrapper for heavy components
- Create error boundary components for graceful error handling
- Add performance monitoring hooks for custom metrics
- Optimize image components with next/image and proper sizing

### File Locations
**New Files to Create:**
- `src/components/ui/optimized-image.tsx` - Optimized image component wrapper
- `src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx` - Error boundary component
- `src/hooks/use-performance.ts` - Performance monitoring hook
- `src/services/error-monitoring.ts` - Error tracking service
- `src/lib/performance-config.ts` - Performance configuration

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Add error boundary and performance monitoring
- `src/services/analytics-service.ts` - Extend for performance metrics
- `src/components/features/homepage/hero-section.tsx` - Optimize images
- `src/components/features/landing-pages/*.tsx` - Optimize service page images
- `next.config.ts` - Add performance optimization configurations

### Testing Requirements
**Performance Testing Standards:**
- Lighthouse CI integration for automated performance testing
- Core Web Vitals testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Bundle size monitoring and alerts
- Error monitoring validation in staging environment
- Performance regression testing for critical user journeys

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Implementation Constraints:**
- Must maintain existing functionality while optimizing
- Error monitoring must not impact user experience
- Performance optimizations must work across all supported browsers
- Bundle size optimizations must not break existing features
- Monitoring data must be GDPR compliant and respect user privacy

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure follows Next.js App Router conventions. Performance optimizations will be implemented using Next.js built-in features like next/image, dynamic imports, and performance monitoring APIs. Error boundaries will be added at the layout level and for critical components.

## Testing
- Lighthouse performance audits for all critical pages
- Bundle size analysis and monitoring
- Error boundary testing with simulated errors
- Performance monitoring validation in staging environment
- Cross-browser performance testing
- Mobile performance testing on various devices
